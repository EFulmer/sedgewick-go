Working through Sedgewick's "Algorithms," ... in Go!

## Why Go?

A couple of reasons, actually.

1. **Why not?** This isn't for anything
2. **Go has a lot going for it.** As a compiled, garbage-collected language, Go has targeted a similar niche to Java. Rob Pike has said that one of the design principles of Go is to improve the productivity of fresh grads. IMO Python is a bit high-level for DSA work: it obscures some performance analysis, like list slicing creating a copy of the list in question. And while I find languages like Haskell and Racket fun and compelling, they use drastically different programming models to the standard mainstream Java/Python/Go/JS imperative paradigm.
3. **Sedgewick's textbook is not concerned with Java.** Combined with the last point, this means Java and Go solutions should look very similar, and there's potential to make my solutions a bit more clear and concise. I'm not a beginner, but learners I have known have been confused by some of the "ceremony" Java has, like everything needing to be in a class, or the distinction between primitive types and object types.
